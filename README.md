## Report

Rick & Morty Api

I had a course assignment that was about fetching and api. We could choose between many different api´s and my taste fell on rick and forty. Half of the reason is because I’m a fan of the show and the other reason was because I felt very comfortable with this api.

I started with making a list on the home page where it display different characters from the show. One of the criteria was that it needed to display three different properties. I choose species, gender and status. This because it was many properties to choose from the json-list and these properties made most sense.

When you click on one of the characters you get directed to the detail page. This usually show the details of one specific characters. Because it wasn’t many properties to choose from, then I decided to keep the same properties that was displayed on the list on the details page.

Last page I made was the contact page. This page have a form that you can use to write on. If the wrong syntax is used the form would not submit and it will tell you were and what you are missing.

CMS course assignment

I had a course assignment that was about cms. The task was to use Wordpress as a tool and to create a headless cms. I used Wordpress to make five different post related to my other course assignment, when I used a Rick and Morty api.That time we already had an api we could choose and just to use javascript to fectch it. Now I wanted to stay in the Rick and Morty world, and decided to make a n api about the planets in Rick and Morty. The fist page displays the whole list of planets by name, and if you press one of them you get quickly directed to the details page. Here you can only see the planet you choose. It display only the planets name. The Name, picture, info and date is displayed on the details page when you click on one of the planets name. I used first local when I was building the site and the json list form the local page. When I was finished I used flywheel as an host and used the json list there. This because now it can be displayed from every devices not only from my pc. I got the info and the pictures of the planets at fan page on the net.(sources)
